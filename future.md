Jin Yang, (Intel Labs)

****Title:** 
A Scalable Formal Approach for Correctness-Assured Hardware Design

**Abstract:** 
Correctness must be a first principle in hardware design, especially for security and safety critical applications. We will give an overview of our scalable approach for correctness-assured hardware design at behavioral level, based on formalizing microarchitecture features as program transformations in an incremental compiler design and microprocessor correctness as a refined notation of compiler correctness. We will show how our approach is applied to designing a formally verified FHE (Fully Homo-morphic Encryption) accelerator.
