**Title:** 

Arc-Lang - A Dataflow Language for Continuous Analytics

**Abstract:** 

Distributed dataflow systems are currently reaching a peak in adoption for cloud-based continuous analytics applications due to their scalability, fault-tolerance, and transactional guarantees. Despite these benefits, the programmability of these systems remains a critical concern. Users can develop continuous analytics applications using either dataflow libraries hosted by general-purpose languages or query languages. While dataflow libraries offer limitless flexibility in what applications can be programmed, this comes at a cost of usability, safety and performance. Conversely, query languages heavily restrict users to the relational model to not fall short in other areas. In this presentation, we discuss current trends in dataflow systems programming, pinpoint problems that serve as opportunities for innovation, and present Arc-Lang, a dataflow language that combines the flexibility of dataflow libraries with the conciseness, safety, and efficiency of query languages. We showcase examples of how Arc-Lang addresses the observed challenges. In particular, Arc-Lang enables correctness through a type system that adheres to dataflow semantics, conciseness through an expressive language integrated query syntax, and performance optimisations by introspecting and rewriting user defined functions and data types prior to execution. Finally, we describe our ongoing work to develop a new dataflow system that takes advantage of Arc-Lang to enable new capabilities.
